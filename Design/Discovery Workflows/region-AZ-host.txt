Objective
---------
fetch some host data (for each host discovered in 'General-Tree':

How to fetch:
---------------  

API:
- nova hypervisor-show 2      // get details of hypervisor with ID=2 !
 -- get hypervisor_hostname, host_ip, hypervisor_type, vcpus, memory_mb, cpu_info_vendor, cpu_info_arch, running_vms, state, status
- neutron agent-list
 -- get 'agent_type' to 'host' associations and 'alive' state, 'admin_state_up' state
 
CLI/SSH:
//login to host_ip
- ifconfig | grep ^eth  
 -- get ethX list // map as pNICs and as Termination-Point 'hostname_ethX'
 -- get HWaddr list per ethX
- ovs-vsctl show
 -- get all data into a JSON named: hostname_OVS
